useless script to show the traceroute functionality.

Clearly, this script is just a POC and nothing more. I just wanted to illustrate how traceroute works, in order to complete my blogpost, at http://lsdsecdaemon.com/highway-to-serv

To run it, just do python default.py <IP_address>
Unfortunately, you need to be root (thanks to ICMP binding)


Enjoy
